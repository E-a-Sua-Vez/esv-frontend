    <h5>Information about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h5>
    <p>We may collect and use information about you if you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we will explain exactly how and why this data is collected, and how we keep it protected from replication or incorrect use.</p>
    <h5>What is GDPR?</h5>
    <p>GDPR is an EU-wide data protection and privacy law that regulates how companies protect the data of EU residents and improves the control that EU residents have over their personal data.</p >
    <p>The GDPR is relevant to any company operating globally and not just to companies based in the EU and EU residents. Our customers' data is important regardless of where it is located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our gold standard for all our operations around the world.</p>
    <h5>What is Personal Data?</h5>
    <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identifiable individual. The GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used alone or in combination with other pieces of information to identity a person. Personal data goes beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation and ethnicity.</p>
    <p>Data protection principles include requirements such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Personal data collected must be processed fairly, lawfully and transparently and must only be used in the way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
    <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfill a specific purpose and should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
    <li>Personal data should not be kept longer than necessary to fulfill its purpose.</li>
    <li>Individuals covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted or moved to another organization.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Why is the GDPR important?</h5>
    <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies must protect the personal data of individuals they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing higher fines for noncompliance. Beyond these facts, it is simply the right thing to do. At It's Your Turn we firmly believe that the privacy of your data is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>
    <h5>Individual rights of the interested party: access, portability and deletion of data</h5>
    <p>We are committed to helping our clients comply with the data subject rights requirements of the GDPR. It's Your Turn processes or stores all personal data with DPA compliant and fully vetted providers. We store all conversations and personal data for up to 6 years, unless your account is deleted. In which case, we delete all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not retain it for longer than 60 days.</p>
    <p>We are aware that if you work with EU clients, you must be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and delete personal data. We have been set up as self-service from the beginning and have always given you access to your data and your customers' data. Our customer support team is here to answer any questions you may have about working with the API.</p>
    <h5>California Residents</h5>
    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose the categories of Personal Information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained previously. </p>
